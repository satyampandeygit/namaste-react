- Framework provides bluepring and basic framework and also tells programmer that what is needed for the customisation.
- Framework provides the flow of the software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required.
- Framework calls the code written by developer as required unlike library where developer calls the code using API.
